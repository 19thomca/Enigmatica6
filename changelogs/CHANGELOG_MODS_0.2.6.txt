			Quarry(s) "Blocks To Mine:" Chat Message was counting all fluid blocks in the area, which was not intended, this update fixes that so you don't think the quarry still has stuff to mine...
			(Was,playing on a server, and it annoyed me, so I fixed it, OKAY!!!)

		Pedestals - 0.7:
			Completed Energy Transferring, Charging, and Discharging Update
			(And Other Fixes and Improvements)
			Added This Update:
			* Energy Import Upgrade
			* Energy Export Upgrade
			* Energy Relay Upgrade
			* Energy Tank Upgrade
			* Energy Smelter Upgrade
			* Energy Crusher Upgrade
			* Energy Sawmill Upgrade
			* Energy Quarry Upgrade
			* Energy Quarry Blacklist Upgrade
			Fixes, Improvements, and Nerfs:
			* Improvement: Added Sounds to a lot of the upgrades to make it more immersive as they operate.
			* Improvement: Reworded the Item Render on pedestals.
			* Improvement: More Particles to display when pedestals have fuel/xp/energy in them.
			* Fixed: Placer Pedestal had a de-sync issue where it still rendered an item when it wasn't in the pedestal.
			* Improvement: Energy being transferred within the Pedestal Energy Network (PEN) has been maximized, only importing and exporting energy into/from the PEN is limited.
			* Improvement: Faber on Direwolf20's discord did an upgrade model re-work, Thanks for that! :D
			* Improvement: Energy upgrades now have a red boarder around them, helping to see them easier in JEI and stuff.
			* Improvement: Milker Upgrade, Now has a Blue Boarder Around it showing its part of the "Fluid" Type of pedestal upgrades.
			* Fixed: An issue where multiple entities within the work area of the Fan Upgrade would cause it to no longer move any of the entities
			* Improvement: Void Upgrade now "Voids" Energy when connected to the PEN
			* Improvement: Quarry Upgrades when clicked with the Upgrade Tool now tell you how many blocks there are remaining to mine.
			* Fixed: Issue where the anvil upgrade wouldn't consume the proper amount of diamonds when over combining.
			* Improvement: enchanter upgrade is now aligned with how the vanilla enchanter works (the xp level your enchanting at is needed in the upgrade in order to enchant, particles are displayed above it when this requirement is met)
			* Improvement: Added additional entity filter types to the Fan, Attacker, and Diffuser. Flying and Mob entity types, this should take care of being able to target phantoms/bats now.
			Details on New Features:
			NOTE: Pedestal Energy Network (PEN)
			Energy Import Upgrade:
			* Dropping redstone on a pedestal upgraded with this will add 2500 energy to the pedestal, Blocks of redstone can be used as well if the upgrades capacity buffer is large enough to hold 22500 energy.
			* This Upgrade when placed on an energy source block (generator or energy storage block) will draw energy out of it as a fixed rate 'Importing' it into the PEN, the maximum transfer is 20krf/t.
			* You can also insert items that store energy to draw energy out of them, they will be transferred out of the pedestal to the next linked pedestal after they are empty of all their energy.
			Energy Export Upgrade:
			* The opposite of the Importer, Placing this on a block that accepts energy (Machine or storage block) will insert 'Extract' energy from the PEN putting it into the 'below' block.
			* You can also insert an item that needs charged with energy, this pedestal will charge it to full, when full it'll transfer it to the next linked pedestal.
			Energy Relay Upgrade:
			* Relays energy within the PEN
			Energy Tank Upgrade:
			* Basically a Relay, but it stores a large amount of energy within the PEN, the maximum storage is 2 billion energy.
			Energy Smelter Upgrade:
			* Just like the Normal Smelter Upgrade, except you need to connect it to the PEN as it'll consume energy and not require solid fuel to be used.
			Energy Crusher Upgrade:
			* Just like the Normal Crusher Upgrade, except you need to connect it to the PEN as it'll consume energy and not require solid fuel to be used.
			Energy Sawmill Upgrade:
			* Just like the Normal Sawmill Upgrade, except you need to connect it to the PEN as it'll consume energy and not require solid fuel to be used.
			Energy Quarry Upgrade:
			* Just like the Normal Quarry Upgrade, except you need to connect it to the PEN as it'll consume energy and not require solid fuel to be used.
			Energy Quarry Blacklist Upgrade:
			* Just like the Normal Quarry Blacklist Upgrade, except you need to connect it to the PEN as it'll consume energy and not require solid fuel to be used.

			* - Documented more in the Patchouli manual (in the "Tools" section)
			* Added a Renewables system!
			* - Make Biodiesel via a multi-step process requiring the production of Yeast Solution, Ethanol and Vegetable Oil

			* Progwidget Item Filter GUI: don't gray out the "Match NBT" checkbox when the filter item has no NBT data
			* - Just because it has no NBT data doesn't mean actual instances of the item can't...

			* - "Tall" blocks being fences, walls, gates...
			* Fixed drones ignoring installed Inventory Upgrades
