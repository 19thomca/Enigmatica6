		v20.17.0 for Forge 1.16.1:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.7.4 and newer.
			+ Added a new button to the waypoints menu options for connecting sub-world from different dimensions mainly for the purpose of cross-dimensional teleportation in multiplayer. If you know that a certain Nether sub-world is from the same world save as your current Overworld sub-world (a vanilla Nether portal takes you there), then you can connect the sub-worlds and be able to teleport. This should fix cross-dimensional teleportation for custom maps from the world map mod. Sub-worlds connected to your current one will be marked with a * symbol and are always at the top of the list.
			* The effective "auto" sub-world should no longer change (when it's supposed to otherwise) while you're managing waypoints in the waypoints menu. This means that selecting a non-auto sub-world and using something like "Make sub-world auto" should not have unexpected results if the "auto" sub-world switches in the background.
			* Fixed waypoints sharing not working for sub-worlds created for custom world maps.
			* Fixed clicking "No" in the confirmation screens for waypoints options closing the options menu.
			* Removed the "MP Cross-Dimensional TP" option as it is no longer needed.

		v20.17.0 for Fabric 1.16.1:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.7.4 and newer.
