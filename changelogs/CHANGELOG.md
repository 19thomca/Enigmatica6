After community feedback, we've decided to re-add Useful Backpacks and Ranged Pumps, as they have features that would be sorely missed.



**Mod Additions**

- Angel Ring [\#144](https://github.com/NillerMedDild/Enigmatica6/issues/144)
- Useful Backpacks
- Ranged Pumps

**Changes**

- Apotheosis: Decreased boss, brutal spawner and swarm spawner frequencies.
- Default Keybindings: Updated with new mod keys, unbound rarely used keys.
- Immersive Engineering: Buffed the Pump's pump speed when powered.
- Ranged Pumps: Increased speed, reduced tank capicity, improved energy capacity, increased energy usage.

**Bug Fixes**

- Mekanism: Disabled Fluorite Ore from spawning, so only the EE variants spawn.
- Unification: Some Mekanism Ores being unprocessable - Not a big deal since you can't obtain them, but still.
- Unification: Chunks only being convertable to smooth stone Ore in the Stonecutter.
- Simply Backpacks erasing items, needs update [\#150](https://github.com/NillerMedDild/Enigmatica6/issues/150)
- No Recipe for Ender Dust [\#149](https://github.com/NillerMedDild/Enigmatica6/issues/149)

**Warning**: Several mods were removed in 0.2.6. If you're using LargeFluidTanks or Useful Backpacks, make sure to move the contents before updating.



If you're playing in a world that was created with Rats (E6 v0.2.4 and earlier), you will need to readd Rats for that world to work correctly. Download it [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rats/files/3020258) and put it in your mods folder.
