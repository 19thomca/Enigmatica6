			(And Other Fixes and Improvements)
			Added This Update:

			* Filter Tag Upgrade
			* Filter Tag Blacklist Upgrade
			* Tag Tool
			Fixes and Improvements:
			* Fixed Export Upgrade not extracting from some inventories.
			* Fixed Redstone Comparator output from pedestals.
			* Fixed pedestals with light able to be colored, which dropped the glowstone out of it.
			* Improvement: All Upgrades that could check a below inventory, can now also check Minecarts that have an Inventory like a Chest Minecart
			* Improvement: Upgrades, Pedestal Capacity/Speed Upgrades, Colored Pallets, and Glowstone no longer consume an item if the player is in creative mode.
			Details on New Features:
			* Void Upgrade
			Crafted with an upgrade base, lava bucket, cactus, and enderpearl, This upgrade makes anything inserted, or dropped on the pedestal get removed from the world, ALSO this pedestal will do void damage to any entities that come into contact with it, Speed and Capacity Enchants can be applied to it.
			* Quarry Upgrade
			Crafted with the Breaker, Magnet, Filter(any), and Smelter Upgrades.
			Functions similar to the tree chopper, except it breaks blocks.
			Like the Breaker Upgrade it was crafted with, It breaks blocks dropping the items, Enchanting this upgrade with silktouch or fortune will apply those effects to the mining.
			Like the Magnet Upgrade it was crafted with, it will magnet up items within the range of operation, putting those items in the pedestal to be transferred out.
			Like the Filter Upgrade it was crafted with, it uses an inventory 'below' as a whitelist of blocks to break, the blacklist version will skip the blocks when mining.
			Like the Smelter Upgrade it was crafted with, this requires fuels to be dropped on the pedestal, 1 coal will mine 8 blocks roughly.
			Powering the pedestal off will halt all its functions except fuel absorption.
			It can be enchanted with Speed, Range(Effects Height), and Capacity (Effects AOE) Enchantments
			It can also be enchanted with Silktouch and Fortune vanilla enchants using the anvil upgrade.
			* Tag Filter / Tag Tool
			Crafted with the Tag Tool and an upgrade base.
			* This set of Upgrades checks a below inventory for a renamed item, the renamed item must be named after a tag to function, for example an item renamed "forge:stone". (one tag name per renamed item)
			* Tag Tool is crafted like the Linking Tool except you replace the diamond with an emerald.
			* With an item in the offhand and the Tag Tool in your main hand, right-click in the air. A message on screen will list all the tags that item has on it, tags can be used to rename items which can be used to filter.
			As always, if you need help with the mod, the discord invite is in the mod listing on the home screen in game. the channel to chat in is #pedestals
