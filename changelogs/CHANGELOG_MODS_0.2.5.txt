It isn't hard to just break a block and replace it or right click the structure with a configurator to make it revalidate and be discovered as found again. There may be some other edge cases where things still don't update properly such as with internal multiblocks that aren't internal (such as induction cells/providers), but for the most part modifying the internals of a structure while it is currently formed is not currently supported

It isn't hard to just break a block and replace it or right click the structure with a configurator to make it revalidate and be discovered as found again. There may be some other edge cases where things still don't update properly such as with internal multiblocks that aren't internal (such as induction cells/providers), but for the most part modifying the internals of a structure while it is currently formed is not currently supported

			[9ec3635](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/9ec36351bc9133c5631f1b05f2fb2d846bad1ed4) - Improve multiblock structure handling so that the structure gets properly rechecked if a position inside the multiblock is modified (for example placing dirt inside an evap tower) [#6352](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6352) Note: The edge case that is currently not handled is if that we don't currently manually re-validate a structure when an invalid block is removed from inside (as we don't have a good way to check if it is inside and we don't want to make multiblock blocks to get laggy when building against them). It isn't hard to just break a block and replace it or right click the structure with a configurator to make it revalidate and be discovered as found again. There may be some other edge cases where things still don't update properly such as with internal multiblocks that aren't internal (such as induction cells/providers), but for the most part modifying the internals of a structure while it is currently formed is not currently supported

	Structure Gel API (Structure Gel API 1.16.1-v1.1.1 --> Structure Gel API 1.16.1-v1.2.1):
		Structure Gel API 1.16.1-v1.2.1:
			Fixes a compatibility issue with version 1.2.0 (archived)
			Version 1.2.0's Changelog:
			Internal code base updates for developers focusing on mob spawns.
			Additions:
			* Added the getspawns command to show what mobs can spawn at your location. It does not take actual spawn conditions like light level into account, only what is allowed to be there assuming all conditions are met.
			Changes:
			* Configs
			* Now work as a builder so that you can customize exactly what you want to have configurable.
			* Usage: new StructureConfigBuilder(builder, "name").probability(0.75).spacing(10).offset(4);
			* The old BiomeStructureConfig and StructureConfig still work as they used to, but now extend off of this new system.
			* Mob spawns can now be configurable for every mob spawn category.
			* Config syntax: [entityID, weight, minGroupCount, maxGroupCount]
			* Example: "[minecraft:zombie, 1, 2, 4][minecraft:skeleton, 2, 2, 4]"
			* Structures
			* Spawns can now be set for every mob classification instead of only hostile and creature.
			* These values are stored in a Map and are set with GelStructure.setSpawnList(EntityClassification, List<SpawnListEntry>). I recommend doing this in your constructor.
			* The old getSpawnList() and getCreatureSpawnList() methods can still be used, but I recommend using the previously mentioned Map as all mob types are handled automatically with it.
			* Spawns are now configurable with GelConfigStructure. (see Configs section)
			* Json Structures
			* This feature has been deprecated and will likely be removed or heavily changed in the future since 1.16.2 does a lot of what this currently does.
			* Added the ability to set mob spawns, similar to how the config does it.
			Fixes:
			* The RegistryHelper methods for registering structures now return "<C extends IFeatureConfig, S extends Structure<C>> S" as opposed to "<C extends IFeatureConfig> Structure<C>", meaning it will return the Structure class passed in.
			* GelStructureStart was extending MarginedStructureStart instead of StructureStart
			* Json structures were being placed in the sky.
			* Gel blocks no longer cause block updates when possible. Hopefully this helps with fps lag when using them, but 1.16 is just silly.

	The Conjurer (The Conjurer 1.16.1-v1.0.6 --> The Conjurer 1.16.1-v1.0.8):

	Xaero's Minimap (v20.17.0 for Forge 1.16.1 --> v20.19.0 for Forge 1.16.1):
		v20.19.0 for Forge 1.16.1:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.8.0 or newer.
			+ Added a new option for ignoring server heightmaps when updating the minimap or detecting caves. Only use this if the default doesn't work on the server you play on.
			* Started using the new waypoint sharing format that supports text formatting from FTB Utilities. The support for the new format has been added months ago, so even old mod versions will be able receive waypoints from this version.
			* Config button in the mod list will now take you to the mod settings.
			* Improved automatic upscale of the minimap, which should better support screen resolutions as high as 16k. This isn't related to the "Minimap Size" option.
			* Improved the update notification to now include all outdated mods created by me that you have, instead of having to deal with them 1 by 1. This only includes mods that support the improved notification (at least 20.19.0 version of this mod and 1.9.0 for the world map).
			* Improved blending of the player arrow edges.
			* Tweaked chunk loading algorithm to work better on very high framerates.
			* Fixed minimap glitching shortly after joining a world/server if the world brightness is the darkest possible. Mostly affected MC 1.12.2 and older.
			+ (Patron-only) Added the "Don't show again for these updates" button to the automatic update screen.

		v20.19.0 for Fabric 1.16.1:

			* Fixed the sub-world list trying to find connected sub-worlds on a non-auto world/server, when there are obviously none.
			* The selected sub-world will now switch to the "auto" on death (before creating a deathpoint) to lessen the potential confusion.
			* Temporary deathpoints will now also be created in all world map-based waypoint sub-worlds, but only if a map hasn't been confirmed yet. This way confirming the map only after you die won't switch you to a sub-world without your latest deathpoint.
			* Updated the crash message to include the new preferred bug report link.
			* Fixed the minimap being glitchy on world join when not using the world map mod.
			* Fixed compatibility with fake worlds (again). For example, fixes crash with bspkrsCore.

	Xaero's World Map (v1.7.4 for Forge 1.16.1 --> v1.9.0 for Forge 1.16.1):
		v1.9.0 for Forge 1.16.1:

			* Increased maximum zoom in from 5x to 50x. Further zoom out is likely coming in the future.
			* Fixed waypoint shadow sprite being affected by global GUI scale.
			* Tweaked chunk loading algorithm to work better on very high framerates.
			* Fixed map scrolling being a little glitchy, especially on older MC versions.
			* Improved the update notification to now include all outdated mods created by me that you have, instead of having to deal with them 1 by 1. This only includes mods that support the improved notification (for example, at least 20.19.0 version of the minimap).

		v1.8.1 for Forge 1.16.1:
			* Compatibility with Xaero's Minimap / Better PVP 20.18.0. No longer compatible with older versions.
			* Reworked when objects of certain classes are (re)constructed. Every object that can potentially "break" because of an exception is now constructed per game connection and not per client instance. This should fix compatibility with something like VanillaFix. This means that reloading a world now reloads the main parts of the mod. One of the effects of this is the world map always being reloaded after a relog.
			* Fixed game crash when loading a corrupt world map cache file.
			* Updated the crash message to include the new preferred bug report link.
