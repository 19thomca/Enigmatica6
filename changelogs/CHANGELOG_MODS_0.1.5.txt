	Xaero's Minimap (v20.15.3 for Forge 1.16.1 --> v20.16.0.1 for Forge 1.16.1):
		v20.16.0.1 for Forge 1.16.1:
			* Compatibility with Xaero's World Map 1.7.4. Not compatible with older versions.
			* Reworked when objects of certain classes are (re)constructed. Every object that can potentially "break" because of an exception is now constructed per game connection and not per client instance. This should fix compatibility with something like VanillaFix. This means that reloading a world now reloads the main parts of the mod, which also means that all waypoints are reloaded from the files (temporary waypoints disappear). I'm planning to make a similar change to the world map mod.
			* Improved security of the "Make Server/World Auto" and "Make Sub-World Auto" features.
			* Improved security of saving mod settings.
