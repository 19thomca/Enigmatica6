	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.1.1-14.jar --> pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.2.0-29.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.2.0-29.jar:
			2.2.0-29 (3 Sep 2020)
			Important: if you are also using Immersive Engineering, this release of PNC:R requires IE 1.16.1-4.0.0-118 or newer.
			Updates
			* Drones (with the Pick up Items widget) will no longer "steal" items off Immersive Engineering conveyor belts
			* - Specifically, the widget now honours the "PreventRemoteMovement" entity tag
			* - This can be overridden via the widget's GUI when creating the drone program
			* A few small cosmetic cleanups and improvements in the Charging Station GUI (including the item upgrade sub-GUI)
			* - Upgrade sub-GUI no longer shows armor slots (it's pointless there)
			* - Reinforced Stone blocks are now a little easier to mine up (blast resistance has not been changed though)
			* Sourdough Bread can now be used to make Culinary Construct sandwiches. Yum.
			* Overhauled the Drone special variables system a bit:
			* - New special variables: $drone_pos, $player_pos, $controller_pos, $owner_pos
			* - Existing variables $drone, $player & $owner still work but it's recommended to use the new ones
			* - Note that $drone gets the blockpos above the drone (which it always has for historical reasons), but $drone_pos gets the drone's real blockpos
			* - $controller_pos is completely new and gets the Programmable Controller's blockpos, or (0,0,0) if used by an actual drone entity
			* Patchouli manual is updated (see Programming / Variables section) with much more detail.
			* Aerial Interface now supports Industrial Foregoing Essence as an XP fluid.
			* Waila now shows 2 decimal places of pressure in the focused block, same as The One Probe already does.
			* When Charging Station is set to output redstone, frequency of signal changes is now limited to at most once every 10 ticks
			* - This should reduce lag caused by rapid output toggling, which can happen when the charged item is at or around the charging threshold
			* Thermal Compressor GUI: temperature gauge scales have been tweaked to hopefully show a clearer distinction between hot & cold sides
			Fixes
			* Fixed (hopefully) an issue where client-side Logistics Frames would disappear on certain blocks
			* - This also caused a client-side crash if right-clicking a "missing" frame with the Logistics Configurator
			* Fixed Elevator sometimes entering an air feedback loop, rapidly leading to explosions
			* Fixed drone Block Right Click widget sometimes bugging out, leaving the drone repeatedly trying to right-click the same block, even when an area is provided
			* Fixed Goto programming widget GUI "Done when departed" and "Done when arrived" meanings being switched.
			* Fixed Programmer not showing programming widgets on hi-dpi displays (Macbooks)
			* Fixed Pressure Chamber crafting issue where items split across multiple stacks would not get recognised as valid recipe ingredients
			* Fixed Liquid Hopper not being able to fill fillable items (buckets, tanks...) dropped in front of the hopper output side.
			* Fixed Pneumatic Armor bound keys also triggering when any GUI is open, e.g. typing in a textfield
			* Fixed Minigun item being rendered too far right in GUI context
			* Fixed Jackhammer item model always rendering with drill bit when not held by player (even when no bit is installed)
			* Fixed Pneumatic Wrench opening machine GUIs when rotating blocks in creative mode
			* Fixed The One Probe showing a block's current pressure where the max pressure should be shown
			* Fixed very long words not being split in GUI side tabs, causing unreadably small text
			* - This mainly affects languages such as Chinese, where whitespace is not necessarily used.
			* Fixed heat-tintable blocks (e.g. Compressed Iron Block) flashing blue briefly when placed down
