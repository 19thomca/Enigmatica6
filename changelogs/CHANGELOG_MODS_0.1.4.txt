	FastWorkbench (FastWorkbench-1.16.1-4.0.1.jar --> FastWorkbench-1.16.1-4.1.1.jar):
		FastWorkbench-1.16.1-4.1.1.jar:
			Removes erroneous debug print

		FastWorkbench-1.16.1-4.1.0.jar:
			Significant improvements have been made to the general systems in place.
			Overall: Less packets are being sent, less items are being shifted around, and everything should just run a bit better. There's less duplication of objects, and a ton of the code is now more extensible (meaning mods can interface with FB way easier now!) and reusable.
			Additionally, the player crafting grid is now supported, so you can craft lag-free in the 2x2 grid. This part requires a coremod, but it is done as non-invasively as possible (it requires two hooks, one to properly handle shift click crafting and one to handle grid updates). Both hooks just call code that FastBench uses for the 3x3 crafting table, with nearly nothing special needed for this support. Any mod wanting to support their own custom crafting grid should be able to do so in a similar fashion.
			This is marked as beta as this is largely untested with mods, but it works perfectly in a vanilla environment.

		Pedestals - 0.3b:
			HOTFIX UPDATE
			I've been informed of some client and server breaking issues with one of the upgrades, luckily due to lack of documentation this hasn't effected too many yet, but that too will change.
			Fixes:
			* Smelter upgrade trying to process materials that dont have smelting recipes, causing a crash until the 'below' inventory is removed.
			* Fixed some upgrades printing values to the console.
			* Fixed some missing tooltips.
			* Added a feature to Smelter, Crusher and Saw Mill, to output any inputs that don't have valid recipes for that function.
			* Fixed xp magnet upgrade not collecting xp from players colliding with pedestal.
			TO NOTE:
			The lack of documentation for the mod has been brought to my attention. I will be working on a text/image based wiki for the mod. I will try to get this fully out before the 0.4 release, with that ill also be doing some short videos as well for those who prefer it that way.
