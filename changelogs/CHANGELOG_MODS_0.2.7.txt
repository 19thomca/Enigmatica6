For example block items that have tags for both the block variant and the item variant now show both (though right clicking on blocks in the world is still likely to provide better results in cases where the block variant of an item cannot be properly determined) - Make the target slot in the dictionary GUI be a "ghost slot" so that things can be dragged from JEI into it ([https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism-Feature-Requests/issues/87](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism-Feature-Requests/issues/87)) - Also fix a few misc issues with scroll lists losing contents/selection index when resizing the minecraft window and make all the click sounds in GUIs properly respect the mek sound config instead of only some of them

From my testing it seems to still be able to load on older versions of JEI and also have older versions of mek load on newer versions of JEI
			[676e785](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/676e7856d8f9bf6a774581cbb0dbb77e656d4c9a) - Bump min forge version to 32.0.104 and update how we handle log stripping, and ground tilling to use the new forge method rather than having using ATs to access the lookup maps
			[1ef2dd9](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1ef2dd99e7f1ccdf2baaa6d2b3656e851e52b961) - Patch silk touch meka-tool still having ores drop xp ([#6427](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6427)).

			[fd596d7](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/fd596d7d09b30192f390224b92c09c9db59a2f4f) - Fix some improper edge case checks when it comes to checking if empty containers can be extracted ([#6425](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6425))
			[a857279](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/a8572791196d30e9108d9db7679c634a42bd7838) - Update list of materials axes work against to match that of vanilla ([#6430](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/6430)).

			[550489c](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/550489c7fcf8d09c46a949dbd1a928edb035ed12) - Revamp dictionary item: - Added a description to the dictionary item to make it more clear what it is used for - Now supports showing the tags for blocks, items, fluids, entities, gases, infuse types, pigments, and slurries - Right clicking an entity or fluid in world now shows their tags - The dictionary's GUI now has a dropdown to view the different tag types that something supports. For example block items that have tags for both the block variant and the item variant now show both (though right clicking on blocks in the world is still likely to provide better results in cases where the block variant of an item cannot be properly determined) - Make the target slot in the dictionary GUI be a "ghost slot" so that things can be dragged from JEI into it ([https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism-Feature-Requests/issues/87](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism-Feature-Requests/issues/87)) - Also fix a few misc issues with scroll lists losing contents/selection index when resizing the minecraft window and make all the click sounds in GUIs properly respect the mek sound config instead of only some of them

	Modular Routers (modular-routers-1.16.1-7.0.0-24.jar --> modular-routers-1.16.1-7.0.1-29.jar):
		modular-routers-1.16.1-7.0.1-29.jar:
			7.0.1 (12 Aug 2020)
			* Update zh_cn translations
			* Added back Waila/Hwyla support
			* Fix crash with Puller Module pulling from Industrial Foregoing Mob Slaughter Factory (possibly other inventories too)
			* Fix crash with unconfigured Fluid Module Mk2 under some circumstances

	NetherPortalFix (NetherPortalFix_1.16.1-7.0.0.jar --> NetherPortalFix_1.16.1-7.0.1.jar):
		NetherPortalFix_1.16.1-7.0.1.jar:
			Fixed crash if player spawned in the Nether directly (without going through a portal or anything)

	Pedestals (Pedestals - 0.7a --> Pedestals - 0.7c):
		Pedestals - 0.7c:
			Translation Update:
			Translations for Chinese (simplified) have been added. Huge thanks to Meawerful in the discord for that work!
			Fixed: Energy Machine Upgrades having duplicate tooltip info.
			Fixed: Added localiations for everything that was missing.
			Improvement: Aligned Energy Quarry Recipe With the Quarry Recipe, now requires an energy furnace upgrade to craft instead of a regular furnace upgrade and a block of redstone.

		Pedestals - 0.7b:
			JEI Integration Update
			(And Other Fixes and Improvements)
			Added This Update:
			* JEI Integration
			* Focused Enchantable Book (Advanced)
			[https://twitter.com/i/status/1293280857814446081](https://twitter.com/i/status/1293280857814446081)
			* This Book Will Only Accept The Advanced Enchantment, IT ALSO IS THE ONLY ITEM THAT CAN BE ENCHANTED WITH THIS ENCHANTMENT.
			* Due to the nature of these books, they can only be combined with items using the Anvil Upgrade.
			* Focus: Advanced (Recipe: Book + Nether Star)
			* (The enchant only appears above level 92)
			Improvement: Cleaned up some texture files, and switched Pedestal texture to a custom white texture, which makes all the other pedestals feel a bit more colorful.

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.0.1-7.jar --> pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.1.1-14.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.1.1-14.jar:
			2.1.1-14 (14 Aug 2020)
			Updates
			* Tweaked heat & air output of advanced compressors somewhat
			* - All compressors now produce heat proportional to the air produced (adding 1 heat per 20 air/tick produced)
			* - This affects the Flux Compressor in particular, which was producing much less heat per air than the Advanced Compressor & Advanced Liquid Compressor
			* - Flux Compressor now produces double the heat it used to, so yes: this can be considered a nerf!
			* - Heat generation will drop a bit as efficiency drops (since less air is being produced)
			* - Fixed issue where fractional amounts of air/tick were getting rounded down (so compressors may produce very slightly more now, depending on circumstances)
			* Added Waila/Hwyla support back in
			* Drone placement tweak: if Drone is deployed on block with no collision box, deploy the Drone in that blockspace instead of the adjacent one
			Fixes
			* Fixed Jackhammer being able to break bedrock (and other unbreakable blocks) in area dig modes
			* Fixed Drone upgrade crafting recipe not needing a PCB ingredient

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.1-2.1.0-11.jar:
			2.1.0-11 (11 Aug 2020)
			This release requires Forge 32.0.108 or newer.
			New
			* Added a Pneumatic Jackhammer!
			* - Powerful and customisable multi-tool which can efficiently break any block
			* - Multiple digging modes, selectable via GUI; better modes require a better Drill Bit to be attached
			* - Includes two vein miner modes: ores & logs only, and all blocks (requires the top-end Netherite Drill Bit)
			* - Upgradable with Speed Upgrades and Volume Upgrades: top speed is extremely fast, but extremely pressure-hungry
			* - Can also take a Fortune or Silk Touch enchanted book (swappable on the fly; no enchanting table needed)
			* - Documented more in the Patchouli manual (in the "Tools" section)
			* Added a Renewables system!
			* - Make Biodiesel via a multi-step process requiring the production of Yeast Solution, Ethanol and Vegetable Oil
			* - Biodiesel is equivalent to Diesel in fuel quality, and can also be used to make Lubricant and Plastic
			* - Some useful by-products & foods are also added:
			*  - Bandages
			*  - A way to get double the Speed Upgrades per bucket of Lubricant
			*  - Sourdough Bread, Chips, Cod & Chips - all good-quality foods
			* - All documented in the Patchouli manual in a new "Renewables" section
			* Added a new Fluid Mixer machine which can mix two fluids into a new fluid and/or item
			* - Used by default for making Biodiesel
			* - Can also mix Water & Lava to make Obsidian
			* - More recipes can be added via datapacks
			Updates
			* Kerosene is now much more efficient in the Kerosene Lamp than other fuels
			* Pneumatic Armor HUD now displays only 1 decimal place of pressure for armor pieces
			* - This is not just a cosmetic change, but part of an overall performance improvement with pressure sync'ing
			* - Previously sync'ing pressures of pneumatic items (including armor) was much too chatty in terms of server->client traffic
			* - Now only rounded air levels are sync'd to client, so the client generally knows item pressures with 0.1 bar of precision
			* - This is enough for the vast majority of display purposes; e.g. item pressure tooltips already display with 0.1 bar of precision
			* - Server->client traffic is now greatly reduced, especially for fast-changing pressures such as Jet Boots
			* Added the option to display graphical bars rather than numbers for Armor HUD pressure readouts
			* - Select this in main "Core Components" armor GUI - it's also persisted to client config (show_pressure_numerically)
			Fixes
			* Fixed buggy drone "Right Click Block" behaviour (ported forward from 1.5.2 version)
			* Progwidget Item Filter GUI: don't gray out the "Match NBT" checkbox when the filter item has no NBT data
			* Just because it has no NBT data doesn't mean actual instances of the item can't...
			* Fixed (worked around) a problem where drones would refuse to pathfind to the space above "tall" blocks
			* "Tall" blocks being fences, walls, gates...
			* Fixed drones ignoring installed Inventory Upgrades
			* Fixed buggy Heat Frame cooling behaviour (would void some fluid containers such as Mekanism tanks)
			* Fixed Logistics Frames not being placeable on the Aerial Interface
			* Fixed possible race conditions when registering custom model loaders (pressure chamber glass, minigun, fluid tanks)
			* - Now using Forge ModelRegistryEvent, hence the 32.0.108 requirement

	Productive Bees (productivebees-1.16.1-0.2.3.jar --> productivebees-1.16.1-0.2.4.jar):

		torchmaster-2.3.2-alpha.jar:
			v2.3.2-alpha
			* replace InvisibleLight Blocks from Feral Flare Lantern with actual light emitting Air Blocks. This should improve compatibility with other mods and MC itself.

			* Added entity black/white listing for megatorch and dreadlamp via config

	Trash Cans (trashcans-1.0.2-mc1.16 --> trashcans-1.0.2a-mc1.16):

		v20.20.0 for Forge 1.16.1:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.10.0 or newer. No longer compatible with older versions.
			+ Added the first server side feature. Installing this mod on the server side (in addition to client) will now make multiworld detection reliable. Although this will change which waypoint sub-world is "auto".
			If you're using the world map mod, then just select your old map and confirm. No further action required as it will also restore your waypoints.
			If you are NOT using the world map, then go to the waypoints menu, select the correct sub-world from the top-right dropdown menu and use Options -> Make Sub-World Auto.
			+ Added a new option "ignoreServerLevelId" to config.txt in XaeroWaypoints for ignoring the new server-controlled sub-world selection.
			* Fixed the mod crashing when installed on server side.
			* Cave detection will now ignore sky light too when the "Ignore Server Heightmaps" option is enabled.
			* Removed API for an old plugin which is out of date and no longer developed.
