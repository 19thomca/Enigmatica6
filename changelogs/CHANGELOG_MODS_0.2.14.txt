			* Improvement: Modified Energy Quarry upgrade to use the Energy Smelter which aligns it more with the normal quarry recipe.
			* Improvement: Fertilizer upgrade can now randomly tick crop blocks, causing them to grow slightly faster even without bonemeal (using bonemeal is still way better)
			* Improvement: Added green rings to the Exp upgrades to make them appear easier to see in jei.
			* Improvement: added enchanting descriptions to Pedestal enchants
			* Improvement: added shift-right click ability to the Upgrade Tool, this now shows the 'Work Area' of the selected pedestal based on its upgrade.
			* Improvement: Effect upgrade no longer consumes the potion in the pedestal if it runs out of blaze powder fuel.
			* Improvement: Upgrade and Linking tool can no longer be inserted into pedestals manually, this is to help with interacting with pedestals for linking and such.
			* Improvement: Upgrade and Linking tool now works in off hand if the first slot in the hotbar is selected.
			* Fixed: Quarry Upgrade Wand Chat Message for 'Blocks Left to Mine' no longer counts fluid blocks.
			* Fixed: The Colored Pallets crafting explosion effect will no longer break things like item frames.

			Details on New Features:
			Advanced Enchantment:
			* Also Added a Focused Book, which is the ONLY item that can get this enchant from an enchanting table, the enchant cant be gotten from villager trades nor dungeon loot.
			* Enchanted in an enchanting table that can enchant over level 92.
			* When added to a pedestal upgrade that interacts with an inventory, it can interact with ANY block or entity with an inventory, so equipping zombies with strong armor to troll your friends with is possible.
			Translations:
			* Huge thanks to Meawerful for the Chinese simplified translations for pedestals! If anyone would like to help with translations for pedestals, please contact me.
			Filtered Import:
			* Will only remove items from an inventory that can be received by a pedestal, this helps keep the pedestal from 'clogging' when there isnt a 'catch all' option available to send to.
			Filtered Export(s):
			* Will only accept items that match whats currently in the connected inventory, the filtering works the same as the normal filters do.
			Filtered Magnet(s):
			* Will only magnet up items if they match whats in the below inventory, the filtering works the same as the normal filters do.
			Filtered Restock:
			* Will only accept items matching whats in the below inventory, and will only accept enough items so that each matching stack will be full, and no extra. this should make crafting a lot easier to do when using this with a filtered import connected to a storage system.
