## Testing
If you would like to help test Enigmatica 6, please give me a shout on Discord.

There are a few things I would like testers to consider/look for:

* Bugs
* Things you find boring/tedious
* Things that need small optimizations, such as advancement text and textures.

I would also appreciate if you let me know what you think of the gameplay and why, especially if you didn't like it :)

Note: You do not have to use the below setup method, you can use the available files from CurseForge or Discord, however those are not updated as frequently as this repository.
